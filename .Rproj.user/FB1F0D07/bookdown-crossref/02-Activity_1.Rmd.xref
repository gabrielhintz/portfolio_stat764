h2:plotmap-your-movement-data.-i-would-recommend-using-r-andor-google-earth-as-i-demonstrated-in-class. Plot/map your movement data. I would recommend using R and/or Google earth as I demonstrated in class.
h2:explore-your-movement-data.-for-example-are-there-any-unique-features-of-your-data-e.g.-a-large-change-in-location-do-your-data-contain-location-error-really-try-to-explore-your-data-as-best-as-possible-using-the-plotsmaps-you-made-in-3. Explore your movement data. For example, are there any unique features of your data (e.g., a large change in location)? Do your data contain location error? Really try to explore your data as best as possible using the plots/maps you made in 3.
h2:fit-a-statistical-or-machine-learning-model-to-your-movement-data.-obtain-predictions-of-your-location-on-a-fine-time-scale-so-that-the-estimates-resemble-a-continuous-trajectory. Fit a statistical or machine learning model to your movement data. Obtain predictions of your location on a fine time scale so that the estimates resemble a continuous trajectory.
h2:plotmap-your-estimated-trajectory-from-5.-explore-your-estimated-trajectory-as-best-as-possible-using-the-plotsmaps.-note-any-unique-features-or-shortcomings-of-your-model. Plot/map your estimated trajectory from 5. Explore your estimated trajectory as best as possible using the plots/maps. Note any unique features or shortcomings of your model.
h2:estimate-a-feature-or-quantity-of-interest-from-your-estimated-trajectory-e.g.-velocity-residence-time-number-of-contacts-etc Estimate a feature or quantity of interest from your estimated trajectory (e.g., velocity, residence time, number of contacts, etc)
