Chose an area on or close to campus where it is easy for you to understand how the elevation changes. For example, I chose the parking lot outside of Dickens Hall. Using a smartphone record the elevation at several locations (points) within the area you chose. I recommend using the app Strava, but you can use whatever you want.
h2:obtain-a-.gpx-or-.csv-file-for-your-elevation-data.-at-minimum-the-file-should-contain-the-location-and-time-of-the-elevation-measurements. Obtain a .gpx or .csv file for your elevation data. At minimum the file should contain the location and time of the elevation measurements.
h2:plotmap-your-elevation-data.-i-would-recommend-using-r-andor-google-earth. Plot/map your elevation data. I would recommend using R and/or Google earth.

Explore your elevation data. For example, are there any unique features of your data? Do your data contain obvious measurement error (e.g., an elevation that can’t possibly be true)? Really try to explore your data as best as possible using the plots/maps you made in .
h2:write-out-the-goals-that-you-wish-to-accomplish-using-your-elevation-data.-for-example-my-goal-was-to-make-a-map-of-the-dickens-hall-parking-lot.-this-involves-using-the-elevation-data-i-collected-to-make-predictions-of-the-elevation-at-any-possible-spatial-locations-within-the-parking-lot.-i-would-also-like-to-make-inference-about-the-location-where-the-elevation-is-lowest-within-the-parking-lot. Write out the goals that you wish to accomplish using your elevation data. For example, my goal was to make a map of the Dicken’s Hall parking lot. This involves using the elevation data I collected to make predictions of the elevation at any possible spatial locations within the parking lot. I would also like to make inference about the location where the elevation is lowest within the parking lot.

Be as creative and inclusive here. For each statistical or machine learning model, make sure you explain each component (piece) of the model
h2:of-the-models-you-developed-in-prompt-6-find-or-develop-software-to-fit-at-least-two-of-these-models-to-your-elevation-data.-note-that-in-a-perfect-world-you-would-be-able-to-either-find-existing-software-or-develop-new-programs-that-enable-you-to-fit-any-statistical-or-machine-learning-model-you-want.-in-reality-you-may-may-end-up-having-to-make-some-unwanted-changes-to-your-models-in-prompt-6-to-be-able-to-find-existing-software-to-fit-these-models-to-the-data. 7). Of the models you developed in prompt #6, find (or develop) software to fit at least two of these models to your elevation data. Note that in a perfect world, you would be able to either find existing software or develop new programs that enable you to fit any statistical or machine learning model you want. In reality, you may may end up having to make some unwanted changes to your models in prompt #6 to be able to find existing software to fit these models to the data.
h2:related-to-prompt-5-use-both-models-you-fit-to-your-elevation-data-in-prompt-7-to-answer-the-questionsgoals.-for-my-elevation-data-this-would-include-making-a-predictive-heatmap-showing-the-elevation-of-the-dickens-hall-parking-lot-and-then-estimating-the-coordinates-of-the-point-where-elevation-is-at-a-minimum. Related to prompt #5, use both models you fit to your elevation data in prompt #7 to answer the questions/goals. For my elevation data, this would include making a predictive heatmap showing the elevation of the Dickens Hall parking lot and then estimating the coordinates of the point where elevation is at a minimum.

Based on the material in Chapter 6 of Spatio-Temporal Statistics with R and our discussion in class on March 26, compare, check and evaluate the two models from #8.
