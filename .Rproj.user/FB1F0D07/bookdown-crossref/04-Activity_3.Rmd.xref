For the data on the abundance of English grain aphids, propose three different statistical models (or machine learning approach) that are capable of predicting the number of English grain aphids at any location within the state of Kansas at any time for the years 2014 and 2015. Make sure to write out the three statistical models using formal notation and fully describe each component using words.
h2:for-the-three-statistical-models-you-proposed-in-question-1-propose-a-way-to-measure-the-accuracy-and-perhaps-the-calibration-of-predictions. For the three statistical models you proposed in question #1, propose a way to measure the accuracy (and perhaps the calibration) of predictions.
